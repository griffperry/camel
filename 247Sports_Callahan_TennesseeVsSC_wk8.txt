If there’s a noteworthy advantage for the Vols on paper going into this game, it might be in the turnover battle. South Carolina, and quarterback Jake Bentley in particular, has been turnover-prone at times. The Gamecocks have 12 turnovers this season, all of which have come within the past five games, and Bentley has thrown a combined seven interceptions in the four SEC games he has played. Tennessee, by comparison, has taken good care of the ball for most of the season. The Vols have 10 giveaways, but six of them came in their loss to Florida last month. Look for South Carolina’s turnover issues to continue, at least to some degree, with Tennessee forcing multiple turnovers, including at least one interception by Bentley. — Ryan Callahan
