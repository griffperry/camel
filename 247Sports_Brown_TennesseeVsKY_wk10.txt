This isn't all that bold because it's happened five times this season. The Vols didn't turn the ball over a single time against West Virginia, East Tennessee State, Auburn, South Carolina and Charlotte. Tennessee won three of those games and easily could have taken home a fourth. The Vols have been solid in taking care of the ball this season aside from the Florida game, when six of their 10 turnovers on the season occurred in a forgettable performance. Kentucky, meanwhile has forced two turnovers in five games this season, came up with four takeaways against South Caroilna and has 14 turnovers forced on the season. Only twice have the Wildcats failed to come up with a turnover in a game this season. Josh Allen leads the SEC with five forced fumbles, but interceptions (and tackles) leader Darius West is suspended for the first half of the game. — Patrick Brown
