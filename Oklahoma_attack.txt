wHAT HAPPENED TO THE aUBURN RUNNING GAME?
fROM 2013 THROUGH THE FIRST THREE GAMES OF THIS SEASON � A SPAN OF 70 GAMES � THE tIGERS RAN FOR FEWER THAN 100 YARDS IN JUST FOUR GAMES, LOSING ALL FOUR.
aUBURN HAS FAILED TO HIT THE 100-YARD RUSHING MARK IN EACH OF ITS LAST THREE GAMES, BUT IT MANAGED TO WIN TWICE.
tHE tENNESSEE DEFENSIVE FRONT HASN�T BEEN A ROCK � STRUGGLING OVER THE LAST TWO GAMES AGAINST fLORIDA AND gEORGIA � BUT aUBURN�S OFFENSIVE LINE IS HAVING AN EVEN TOUGHER TIME.
aUBURN ISN�T CONTROLLING THE CLOCK, THE OFFENSE ISN�T MAKING THE MOST OF ITS CHANCES, AND THERE�S BEEN A BIG PROBLEM WITH FUMBLES AND PENALTIES.
tHE vOLS NEED ALL OF THE HELP THEY CAN GET.
tHERE HAVE BEEN A WHOLE SLEW OF ISSUES, BUT THEY�RE NOT HURTING THEMSELVES WITH PENALTIES, AND THEY�RE NOT HAVING THAT MANY PROBLEMS WITH TURNOVERS. bUT �
oNE rEASON wHY aUBURN wILL wIN
tHE tENNESSEE OFFENSIVE LINE IS STRUGGLING.
tHE vOLS ARE ALLOWING WAY TOO MANY PLAYS BEHIND THE LINE � IT�S EASY TO GET INTO THE BACKFIELD ON A REGULAR BASIS, ESPECIALLY ON THIRD DOWNS � AND IT�S SHOWING FOR AN OFFENSE THAT�S HAVING PROBLEMS GETTING ANYTHING GOING.
fOR ALL OF aUBURN�S ISSUES. THE DEFENSE IS DOING ITS PART AT GENERATING PRESSURE AND KEEPING THE TEAM IN GAMES. iT�S ONLY GIVING UP AN AVERAGE OF 14 POINTS PER GAME, MAINLY BECAUSE IT�S GETTING OFF THE FIELD.
aUBURN HAS ALLOWED TEAMS TO CONVERT 40% OF THEIR THIRD DOWN CHANCES OR MORE IN TWO GAMES � THE LOSSES TO lsu AND mISSISSIPPI sTATE. tEAMS HAVE BEEN UNDER THE 40% MARK IN THE FOUR tIGER WINS.
tENNESSEE IS CONVERTING JUST 36% OF ITS THIRD DOWN TRIES.
wHAT�S gOING tO hAPPEN
wITH TWO WEEKS OFF TO RECHARGE THE BATTERIES, THE aUBURN OFFENSE WILL COME UP WITH A FEW GOOD EARLY SCORING DRIVES, AND THEN THE DEFENSE WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST.
tHE tIGERS WON�T COME UP WITH A GIANT OFFENSIVE PERFORMANCE, BUT IT�LL GET AHEAD AND STAY THERE. tHE tENNESSEE OFFENSE WON�T KEEP THE aUBURN DEFENSIVE FRONT OUT OF THE BACKFIELD � THE PRESSURE WILL COME IN WAVES.
