On paper, this looks like a terrible matchup for Tennessee, in many ways.

The Vols are short enough on proven cornerbacks that two true freshmen are listed as co-starters, and they’ll have to try to slow down an offense that averaged more than 300 passing yards per game last season. We also don’t know that they have a good enough pass rush to cause problems for quarterback Will Grier — or a run defense that can stop anybody, based on what we saw last year.

West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen has said some goofy things recently that made it seem like the Mountaineers might be more worried about Tennessee than a lot of analysts would have expected. And the Vols, starting with Pruitt, seem more confident than you would expect a team to be coming off a 4-8 season. But those kinds of things, especially leading up to a season opener, can be misleading.

I do think it will be a closer game than I once expected. I think it will be competitive until the fourth quarter, and the Vols will look pretty good at times. But their offense isn't good enough to keep up with West Virginia for four quarters. WEST VIRGINIA 38, TENNESSEE 27
