Austin Burlage: Florida 19, Tennessee 13

(Season: 3-0)

There is a lot to feel good about here if you’re a Vols fan. The Gators don’t have great QB play. They’re playing their first road game of the year in front of what will likely be a totally insane Neyland Stadium crowd. They recently lost to Kentucky for the first time in decades.

Here’s the thing, though. Tennessee has yet to do anything offensively in their first three games that would lead me to believe they will have the offense needed to win this game. Sure, the Vols have some extremely talented players. But for whatever reason it just hasn’t seemed to click yet as a whole. The Vols put up 24 at home against UTEP. That’s a touchdown less than what FCS Northern Arizona put on UTEP when the Miners were at home.

It sounds like Tennessee has had a great week of practice, and that’s encouraging. I think it’s close. Tennessee may even have a shot at the end. But I’m skeptical that we’ll be able to punch it in enough to come out with a victory.
