Conner Knapp: Florida 17, Tennessee 13

(Season: 2-1)

As is usually the case by Friday, I have almost talked myself out of whatever concerns I have in relation to the Vols and blindly thrown my faith behind them.

I just can’t pick Tennessee to beat Florida again. I’ve been burned too many times.

I think this is going to be a close game decided in the fourth quarter, but I just can’t pick Tennessee to win this game which it has struggled to put away in recent years.
