Noah Taylor: Tennessee 20, Florida 19

(Season: 3-0)

Has there been a game in major college football as unpredictable as the Florida-Tennessee game has been in recent memory? This one will be no exception. 

I haven’t seen enough from either team-who are both going through big transitions-to be confident either way. But with what promises to be an electric environment under the lights at Neyland Stadium on Saturday night, I think Florida struggles in their first road game which will result in a mistake or two that decides the game.

But, then again, the complete opposite could happen. Who knows?
