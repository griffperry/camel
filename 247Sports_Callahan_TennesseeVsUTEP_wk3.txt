East Tennessee State was no match for Tennessee last week, and while it might seem hard to believe, UTEP won’t give Tennessee any more of a test.

Yes, the Buccaneers are a Football Championship Subdivision team and UTEP is a Football Bowl Subdivision team. But the Miners went winless last year, losing all but one of their games by at least two touchdowns. And they already have lost their first two games this year by 20 points or more, including a season-opening 30-10 loss to Northern Arizona, an FCS team.

Tennessee should have no problem winning by a comfortable margin. This game should give the Vols another chance to work on themselves and answer some important questions — particularly about their offensive line and their secondary — going into next week’s SEC opener against rival Florida.

The only questions about this game are whether Tennessee will show up ready to play and just how big the Vols’ margin of victory will be. TENNESSEE 45, UTEP 10
