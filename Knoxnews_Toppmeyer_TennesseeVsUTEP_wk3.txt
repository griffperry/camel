Tennessee slogged its way to a 24-0 victory over UTEP on Saturday in its final tuneup before entering SEC play against Florida next week.

“It’d be hard to beat anybody in the SEC playing like that," an unsatisfied coach Jeremy Pruitt said.

The Vols (2-1) were far from flawless, but they were good enough to hand the Miners (0-3) their 15th straight loss.

UTEP had allowed 82 points in its first two games.
When you say 24 points, it’s not where we want to be," Pruitt said. "Absolutely not.”

Here are five things we learned.

Another slow start for Tennessee
On Monday, Pruitt bemoaned his team’s slow starts. The Vols suffered another Saturday.

Despite piling up 259 first-half yards, the Vols entered the locker room holding a 10-0 lead. Ty Chandler ran 81 yards untouched for a touchdown on UT's first play of the third quarter to provide some breathing room.

“I tried to get top speed and get to the end zone," Chandler said of his burst through the left side of the line and up the sideline.

UT also started slow in last week’s blowout over East Tennessee State, and it had a scoreless first quarter in a season-opening loss to West Virginia.
