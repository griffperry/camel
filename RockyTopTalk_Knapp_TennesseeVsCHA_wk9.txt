Conner Knapp: Tennessee 41, Charlotte 17

(Season: 6-2)

I like the way Jeremy Pruitt and his players have approached this week. It is apparent that Tennessee is not taking Charlotte lightly.

This should be a pretty clean game for the Vols as they look to get a win back heading into the most crucial part of the season.
