Conner Knapp: Auburn 31, Tennessee 13

(Season: 4-1)

I think many people are far too bullish on Tennessee’s chances going into this game.

Auburn has sputtered after beginning the season with national championship hopes, but the Tigers are still leaps and bounds ahead of Tennessee. Auburn’s defensive front against the Tennessee offensive line might be the biggest mismatch the Vols face this year outside of Alabama.

Auburn recovers from its disappointing loss at Mississippi State and beats Tennessee with relative ease.
