Noah Taylor: Georgia 49, Tennessee 17

(Season: 3-1)

At some point, Tennessee will turn the corner under Jeremy Pruitt. At some point, Tennessee will snap an historically bad losing streak in SEC play. Just don’t expect any of that to happen this weekend in Athens.

Georgia is just game one in an extremely tough stretch for the Vols that also includes meetings with No. 10 Auburn and No. 1 Alabama. When looking at the schedule before the season began, I believed that Florida, Kentucky and Vanderbilt were Tennessee’s best chance to get an SEC win. After getting routed at home by the Gators last week and seeing the Wildcats surge to No. 17 in the country after a 4-0 start, I’m not sure when that coveted conference win is going to come.
