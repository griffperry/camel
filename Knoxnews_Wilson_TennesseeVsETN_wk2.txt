For the second straight week, the first quarter was really rough and the second quarter was really good for the Vols.

Tennessee didn’t break 100 yards offensively in the first quarter and was slumping through the early second. But after a 48-minute weather delay, UT’s offense figured it out. The Vols ran 14 plays for 140 yards and scored 21 points in the rest of the frame to take control.
UT kept building from that point to score six offensive touchdowns and amass more than 400 total yards.

It was a good day for Jarrett Guarantano, who built on a strong opening week. Tennessee’s running backs had a great day as a group, with Jeremy Banks and Madre London scoring two touchdowns each.

The offensive line had a shaky start, to put it nicely, but settled in and performed well in both run and pass blocking.

ETSU was clearly overmatched physically throughout the game. The Vols are bigger, faster and stronger. It showed and they played like it.

UT did not allow a first down in the first quarter, while holding ETSU to zero rushing yards.

Then the defense turned it up a notch in the second quarter and went from stopping to play-making. Tennessee picked off ETSU’s Logan Marchi on consecutive possessions. Freshman cornerback Bryce Thompson got the first, almost returning it for a touchdown.
