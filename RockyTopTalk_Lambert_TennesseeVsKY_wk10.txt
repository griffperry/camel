Terry Lambert: Tennessee 16, Kentucky 13

(Season: 6-3)

I’m going back to the Vols here, even after they burned me in the fourth quarter in Columbia. As Conner mentioned above, Kentucky is one-dimensional. I think Pruitt can work his magic to contain Snell a little. The key to me is stopping Terry Wilson.

I’m expecting a similar game plan to the South Carolina game from Tyson Helton — short passes on the outside to their playmakers. Tennessee probably isn’t as bad as they looked last week and the Wildcats have struggled through the past three weeks.

Pruitt finds one more signature win in 2018.
