Benny Snell is one of the best running backs in college football, and Tennessee’s defense is hardly elite, so this prediction might seem a bit crazy on paper. But we’re supposed to be bold, right? I think Snell has clearly banged up or worn down the past couple of weeks, and I think the Vols have enough size, strength and toughness in the heart of their defense to keep him contained. The much bigger concern I have for Tennessee’s defense is actually quarterback Terry Wilson’s ability to make and extend plays with his legs. I think that could be a big problem for a Tennessee defense that has a nasty habit of losing sack and tackle-for-loss chances in the backfield. — Wes Rucker
