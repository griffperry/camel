Austin Burlage: Kentucky 20 , Tennessee 13

(Season: 8-1)

The die hard Vols fan in me wants to believe this is a Tennessee win. After all, Kentucky hasn’t looked particularly great over their most recent games. Certainly not as good as their #11 overall ranking would indicate. Over the past four weeks the Wildcats are 2-2 and have averaged an abysmal 15 points in those games.

However, Kentucky’s whole body of work this year is actually quite impressive. They are a sound team, anchored by their defense. Florida, Mississippi State, Texas A&M, and Missouri all rank in the top half of the SEC in total offense. None of these teams scored more than 20 points on Kentucky, and the Wildcats were on the road to face three of those four teams. Given Tennessee’s offensive game plan in recent weeks I expect to see a moderate ability to move the ball with short passes. But I question if that will translate to points on the scoreboard. I’m going with the Wildcats in this one. We’ll get them back come basketball season.
