I looked stupid picking Tennessee to beat Florida three weeks ago. So did my colleagues. But you’re made to look stupid when a team comes out at home against a rival and gives up six turnovers, a safety and fails to recover a surprise onside kick, all en route to digging a 33-3 hole. It was a 24-0 hole a couple weeks ago at No. 2 Georgia, but the Vols showed progress by getting it back down to 24-12 before running out of steam.

Jeremy Pruitt said Wednesday that his team has progressed in all three phases, that they’re learning to practice the proper way, and surely that will translate on game day at some point.

On the other side, Auburn is frustrated. Gus Malzahn came out and said it this week. He’s frustrated, his players are frustrated, his staff is frustrated, the Auburn fan base is frustrated. Going from a top-10 team to two conference losses by the halfway point of the schedule will do that to a program.

On Saturday, with what could be a sleepy 11 a.m. local time kickoff in front of what could be a less-than-capacity crowd, the Vols need to get some momentum early and see how far they can ride it. The disaster scenario is Auburn getting something going early and Tennessee being the remedy for the frustrations they’re currently living with.

Then there’s the other scenario: The Vols play Auburn tough, but Auburn finds a way to hold them off in the second half. It wouldn’t be fun, but technically it would be progress for this Tennessee team, one that’s trying to crawl before it walks and walk before it runs. AUBURN 27, TENNESSEE 17
