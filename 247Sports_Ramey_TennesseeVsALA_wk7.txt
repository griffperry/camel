JJ Peterson makes his tennessee debut. I’m going all in on conspiracy theories in this one. Back on the morning of Sept. 29, the day Tennessee would fall 38-12 at No. 2 Georgia, highly touted freshman JJ Peterson posted a picture of a Tennessee football pocket schedule on Snapchat. Four dates on that schedule had been circled by Peterson: Alabama, South Carolina, Kentucky and Vanderbilt. Why circle four dates? It just so happens that freshmen can now play in four games while maintaining redshirt eligibility. Since then, outside linebacker Jonathan Kongbo has been lost to a season-ending ACL tear and it just so happens that Peterson got some reps at outside linebacker in practice this week. Long story short: Peterson plays in some capacity today, baptized by fire against No. 1 Alabama. — Grant Ramey
