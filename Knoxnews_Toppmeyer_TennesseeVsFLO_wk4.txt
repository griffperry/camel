Tennessee’s first two home games – daytime kickoffs against East Tennessee State and UTEP – didn’t offer much sizzle.

The stakes will raise when the Vols (2-1) host Florida (2-1) on Saturday (7 p.m. ET, ESPN). First-year Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt expects a raucous crowd at Neyland Stadium.

“When Florida’s got the ball, I bet you they can’t hear with the way our fans (are), because our fans are going to be ready for this game, I can tell you that,” Pruitt said during Sunday’s airing of the “Jeremy Pruitt Show.”

“We can make it hard for those guys to operate, so it’ll definitely be an advantage. I think everybody that’s associated with the University of Tennessee and this program has got to be excited about playing the Gators.”

It was a different scene Saturday for the Vols’ 24-0 win over UTEP (0-3), when there were scores of empty seats, especially in the upper deck, among an announced crowd of 87,074.

But that was a game against one of the worst FBS programs. This week will be the first rivalry game of the Pruitt era.

“We got the Florida Gators this next week, and I think that’s why a lot of these guys came to Tennessee, is to play in games like this,” Pruitt said on his television show. “I know it’s why I came here to coach.”

Pruitt thought those two pass breakups should have been interceptions.

“We had no turnovers on defense, and it’s going to be hard to win in the SEC moving forward if we’re not creating any turnovers,” Pruitt said after Saturday’s game. “We’re going to have to be a team that creates a bunch of turnovers. There are balls hitting us in the head, in the hands, and we’re going to have to find guys that can play the ball and finish on the ball and then get the ball off of the quarterback and the runners.”

After forcing three turnovers in a 59-3 victory over ETSU, the Vols had no takeaways against UTEP. For the season, they have four takeaways and a plus-two turnover margin.
