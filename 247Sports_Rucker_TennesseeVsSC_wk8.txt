I think Tennessee freshman cornerback Alontae Taylor is a good player. I don’t know if he’s quite as great at some statistics suggest just yet, but I think he’s already a good player and become a really good or great player in the future. Taylor also seems like a kid who cares, and I believe his apology to teammates after last week’s silly ejection in the loss to Alabama was sincere. I think he’ll bounce back and play pretty well in this game, and he’ll need to play well, because Tennessee’s secondary is short on numbers and South Carolina has two of the SEC’s best wide receivers. I think Taylor will take part in a turnover today. By that I mean I think he’ll either intercept a pass, force a fumble or recover a fumble. I think he’ll make a big play.— Wes Rucker
