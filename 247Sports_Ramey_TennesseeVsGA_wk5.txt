Tennessee isn’t a very good football team right now. That’s the expert analysis you were looking for after last week’s six-turnover-and-a-safety-and-a-failed-onside-kick debacle.

But that doesn’t mean the Vols can’t get better or play better. Just hang onto the ball better. Get better at generating a turnover here or there. The next month of football isn’t going to be fun aside from, you know, the bye week. But Tennessee has to find a way to make progress despite what the scoreboard says against Georgia, Auburn, Alabama and perhaps South Carolina.

They have to find a way to get better at the things that Jeremy Pruitt keeps harping on — like taking care of the ball offensively and forcing turnovers defensively — if they’re going to have a chance to win games once November rolls around. GEORGIA 41, TENNESSEE 10
