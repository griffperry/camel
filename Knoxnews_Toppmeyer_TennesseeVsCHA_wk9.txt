Tennessee 38, Charlotte 14: Charlotte is better than UTEP, which the Vols beat 24-0 in Week 3.

But this is still a cupcake game, and if the Vols are good enough to beat Auburn and hang with South Carolina until the end, they’re good enough to win comfortably Saturday.

This should be a chance for Jarrett Guarantano to continue building momentum going into a key game next week against Kentucky.
