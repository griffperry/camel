Tennessee stripped away Sanders’ chance for a bare stroll with a 28-point second quarter, pulling away for a 59-3 victory at Neyland Stadium.

It marked the first win of the Jeremy Pruitt era.

“We came out and executed on all sides of the ball, and that’s key," center Ryan Johnson said. "Defense really held their ground. They made some key plays, got some turnovers. Special teams did their job flawlessly, and I think that’s really, really key.”

The Vols improved to 1-1. ETSU is 1-1.

Here are five things we learned:

Vols defense dominates
The Vols’ defense produced more points than ETSU's offense.

Darrin Kirkland Jr. snagged a deflected pass and returned the interception 33 yards for a second-quarter touchdown. Earlier, Bryce Thompson grabbed a deflected pass and returned his pick to the 3, setting up Jeremy Banks’ second rushing touchdown.

The Buccaneers gained 194 yards on 58 plays.
Is a passing connection emerging?
Jarrett Guarantano connected with Marquez Callaway five times for 78 yards. The duo is forming a nice connection. Callaway caught six passes last week.

“Having that good chemistry is going to help us better off in future games," Callaway said.

Saturday's highlight was a 51-yard bomb that Callaway hauled in despite being harassed by Karon Delince, who was flagged for pass interference. UT declined the penalty.
Guarantano finished 8-of-13 passing for 154 yards. Backup Keller Chryst was 3-for-3 for 70 yards.

Concerns about the offensive line
ETSU had its way with the Vols’ offensive line during the first quarter. A prime example came when UT had first-and-goal from the 4 after Guarantano completed a 51-yard pass to Josh Palmer.

Bucs defenders tore through the line on consecutive plays, stuffing Tim Jordan for losses of 3 and 7 yards. On third down, Nasir Player blew past right tackle Drew Richmond to pressure Guarantano, whose pass was incomplete. The Vols settled for a field goal.
