Austin Burlage: Georgia 52, Tennessee 3

(Season: 4-0)

Wheeeeew. That prediction is tough to even write. But here’s the thing. Georgia has put up at least forty points on every opponent they’ve played this season. That includes #24 South Carolina. In many of these games it doesn’t look like Georgia has even broken much of a sweat. On the flip side, Tennessee struggled to shut down a Feleipe Franks led Florida team at home. Franks managed 3 touchdowns passing and 1 rushing along with 0 turnovers against the Vols.

Tennessee’s offensive problems are well known. It’s still unclear what the Vols’s identity is on this side of the ball. And, an offensive line unit that has struggled all season will now face their toughest test yet.

But there is still more to consider in this game. For one, it’s a rivalry game, so Georgia should be extra motivated to run up the score. Secondly, Tennessee has actually won 2 of the last 3 meetings against the Bulldogs including the most recent game in Athens. I think we all remember how that ended. Georgia will keep their foot on the gas in this one. Add in the motivation of beating your former defensive coordinator to this mix as well, and it looks like another long Saturday for the men in orange and white.
