Terry Lambert: Tennessee 23, South Carolina 20

(Season: 5-2)

Even with the loss of Trey Smith, I’m rolling with the Vols on Saturday. I really wish that Alabama game didn’t happen when it did, because this team seemed to really be turning a corner. The Alabama blowout shouldn’t change that feeling. That’s a lot more about how great they are than how bad Tennessee is.

Turnover-prone quarterback Jake Bentley will face a defense that is coming along nicely. They forced four fumbles against Georgia and have back to back games with a defensive touchdown now under their belt. Pruitt is starting to work his magic on that side of the ball. As long as Tennessee has a decent day on offense, I think the Vols find a way to get the job done.
