Terry Lambert: Tennessee 48, UTEP 6

(Season: 2-0)

UTEP is bad. Like, lost 14 in a row bad. Tennessee will roll for the second week in a row without much drama. The offensive line does have to get off to a better start this time around, however. It’s going to be bad news if that happens next weekend.
