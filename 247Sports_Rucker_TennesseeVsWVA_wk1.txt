As recently as a week or two ago, I would have called anyone picking Tennessee to win this game crazy.

That’s not the case now. The Vols have started feeling much more confident for one reason or another, and I don’t love the vibe I’m getting from up there in Morgantown.

But … I can’t get over the matchup of West Virginia’s passing game against Tennessee’s secondary. Yes, Jeremy Pruitt is one of the nation’s best defensive backs coaches, but trying to put the pieces together in time for this game seems like a stretch to me. I can’t get past those numbers. I just can’t. West Virginia’s passing game was so good last season, and Tennessee’s secondary was so bad last season, and a lot of the same pieces are back for both teams. Coaching helps, but I’m not sure it can move that mountain in just nine months.

I do think Tennessee will find ways to move the ball and score points on West Virginia’s defense, and I do think the Vols will make this an interesting game. But I don’t think they’ll win the game. WEST VIRGINIA 35, TENNESSEE 28
