Terry Lambert: Tennessee 38, Charlotte 16

(Season: 5-3)

It’s an interesting spot for Tennessee here. Jeremy Pruitt has said all of the right things this week and seems to be taking Charlotte seriously, but we’ll see how the team responds on Saturday. Regardless, they’re the more talented team here. I’m fully expecting some sleepy moments in this one, but the Vols will eventually put some distance in between themselves and the 49ers eventually.
