When in doubt, go with Florida, right? If that’s been your guiding principle in picking winners in the Tennessee-Florida game, you’ve been in pretty good shape for most of the past two decades. That’s been the guiding principle throughout most of my time covering the Vols. Any time I can’t make up my mind on who to pick in this rivalry full of great games, I go with the Gators.

I haven’t been able to make up my mind all week, so naturally I’m going to … do what I almost never do. I’m picking Tennessee — and not just to cover, but to win the game outright.

These two teams have so many similarities, but I like Tennessee’s situation at quarterback a little better, and this game is in Knoxville. But that’s not the biggest reason I’m picking Tennessee.

We’ve seen Florida struggle offensively at times in recent years, but the Gators have almost always had a great defense capable of overcoming that. I don’t think this Florida team has a good defense. I think it’s just OK. Tennessee is just OK on offense, but Florida isn’t much better on defense.

Nothing would shock me in this game, and I think a non-offensive touchdown by either team would be the difference. If that doesn’t happen, though, I think Tennessee will win this one. TENNESSEE 26, FLORIDA 24
