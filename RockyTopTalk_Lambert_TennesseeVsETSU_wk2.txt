Terry Lambert: Tennessee 42, ETSU 14

(Season: 1-0)

Tennessee will roll here. The only intrigue in this one will be seeing if the offense can open things up and how the offensive line will shape up without Brandon Kennedy. I’m also interested in seeing if some of the freshmen get more run in what should be a favorable situation.
