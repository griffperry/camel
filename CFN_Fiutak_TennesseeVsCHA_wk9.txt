Charlotte (4-4) vs. Tennessee (3-5) Game Preview
– Free daily ATS lock pick just released: ‘100% confidence release!’

What’s Going To Happen
Yeah, Tennessee has lost four of the last five games, but it beat Auburn along the way and it’s been playing well enough to at least be competitive. Now it’s time to go on run.

The Vols can still go bowling, but they have to win four of their last five games, and it’s not asking for the world with winnable games against Missouri and Vanderbilt after playing Kentucky.

First, they have to get by a decent Charlotte team looking to come up with something special win coming off a nice win over Southern Miss.

The 49ers don’t have too much of an offense, and they struggle to score, but they’re tough against the run and they’re amazing at controlling the clock. They’re third in the country in time of possession, they’re wonderful at slowing games down, and they’re able to drag teams down to their level.

But they’re not good against anyone who can throw reasonably well.

Jarrett Guarantano has hit over 60% of his passes for three of the last four games – only going under the mark against Alabama. He’ll connect for two touchdown passes early on, and Tennessee will be Charlotte at its own game by controlling the clock and the tempo.

It’s the first time this year Charlotte will play a Power Five team, and it’ll look like it.

Fearless Prediction & Line
Tennessee 41, Charlotte 17
Line: Tennessee -21, o/u: 48
ATS Confidence out of 5: 3
