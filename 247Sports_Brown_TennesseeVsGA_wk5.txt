Two years ago, Tennessee went to Athens as a slight favorite and came out with one of the most memorable wins in the history of the program. Now the Vols are going to Athens as a 31.5-point underdog and with a 2.6 percent chance of winning, according to ESPN's Football Power Index. For comparison's sake, the FPI last week gave Old Dominion a 1.8 percent chance of upsetting Virginia Tech.

Another illustration of Tennessee's precipitous drop since 2016: The Vols had enough talent two seasons ago to commit seven turnovers and still almost win a road game against a top-10 team — yes, Texas A&M tanked late in that season, but still. This season, six turnovers got Tennessee beat by 26 points against a middling-at-best Florida team. In that same time, however, Georgia has morphed into Alabama East and is leaving the rest of the SEC East out of sight behind it.

The Bulldogs didn't play near their best at Missouri last week, and I expect them to be sharper and more energized in their first SEC home game of the season. I expect Jeremy Pruitt will take his transitioning team into Athens and give it a go, but unfortunately for the Vols, the gap between these teams is pretty large right now. It was 41-0 large last season, but it’d be disappointing if Tennessee is completely out of the game by halftime. GEORGIA 43, TENNESSEE 17
