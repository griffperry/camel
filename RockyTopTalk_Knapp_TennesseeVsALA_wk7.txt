Conner Knapp: Alabama 45, Tennessee 24

(Season: 4-2)

While Tennessee snapped its SEC losing streak last week and has some positive momentum, the Vols are not going to end their 10-year losing streak to Alabama — and that’s fine.

Whatever happens against the best team in the country is inconsequential to the rest of Tennessee’s season. All the Vols can do on Saturday is give their best effort and when it’s over, re-set their sights on a winnable latter portion of the schedule and trying to reach a bowl game.
