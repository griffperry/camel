Tennessee’s defense has had its moments this season, but the Vols have struggled to contain really good offenses. Good news, Vols: Charlotte isn’t good on offense. In fact, the 49ers have one of the worst offenses in NCAA Division I FBS football. They’ve relied on a really good defense to get them four wins in their first eight games, and they’ve needed that, because they average just 340.3 yards per game. Very few offenses are worse than that, and Tennessee has faced one of them this season. Things didn’t go well for UTEP, and they won’t go well for the 49ers, either. I think Charlotte will finish the game with less than 250 yards from scrimmage — and before you suggest that isn’t bold, consider the fact that only one offense in the country (Texas-San Antonio) averages less than 270 yards per game. — Wes Rucker
