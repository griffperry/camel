Conner Knapp: Tennessee 28, West Virginia 24

Why not?

It’s a new era. I think West Virginia, while certainly a good team, is coming in a bit overrated. Honestly, I just want to believe. Maybe Tennessee gets shelled, but I really think the Vols have the talent on defense to keep WVU in check. If Tennessee can get to 28 points, I’ll take my chances.
