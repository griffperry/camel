Much was made about sophomore kicker Brent Cimaglia not getting a chance for a long field goal last week at South Carolina, with the Vols opting to go for it due to field position and the wind in their face. The Franklin, Tenn., native will get his shot this week, connecting on a career-long field goal against Charlotte during Homecoming weekend. Cimaglia was good from 51 yards last season at Florida — his current career long — so give me a 52 yarder against the Niners. — Grant Ramey
