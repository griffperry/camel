Honestly, I have no idea. I think these two teams are even enough — or perhaps Florida has a slight talent advantage, but still — that home-field advantage and a night game at Neyland Stadium could make the difference for the Vols.

The offensive line will have to protect — Cece Jefferson can be a problem for a lot of people —and Tennessee needs to control the tempo through the run game and again ask Jarrett Guarantano to stay within himself.

Extend the game, get it to the fourth quarter and hope the crowd and playmaking at opportune times can make the difference. The Vols got it to halftime against West Virginia, a much more difficult opponent to handle. Now get it to the fourth quarter against Florida and see what happens.

This game is far from deciding the SEC East like it used to. But it’s a first-year coaching staff at both schools as they start over. Winning this one could go a long way for either side in the rivalry. TENNESSEE 13, FLORIDA 12
