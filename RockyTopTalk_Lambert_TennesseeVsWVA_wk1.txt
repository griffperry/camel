Terry Lambert: West Virginia 38, Tennessee 30

I want to pull the trigger on the upset, but I just can’t quite get there. I think the Vols will have their shots to win this one, but inexperience at cornerback and no proven pass rush is just too much for me to ignore.

Tennessee should be able to run the ball, hopefully keeping Will Grier off the field. I’m just not sold that they’re going to be able to get the stops when they need them.
