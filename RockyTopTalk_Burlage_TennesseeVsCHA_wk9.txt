Austin Burlage: Tennessee 38, Charlotte 3

(Season: 7-1)

Tennessee is by far the better team in this game. Following a humiliating home loss to rival Alabama, and a close loss to division rival South Carolina, the Vols will be looking to take out some frustration on an inferior opponent.

Another consideration is that Charlotte might be looking ahead. Sure, they’ll be excited to play at an SEC team. But, they’re stepping into Neyland knowing that they are not as big, strong, fast, or athletic across the board as Tennessee. Currently they sit at 4th in within the C-USA Eastern division. However, they play both the first and third ranked teams within their division to close out their season. By winning out in conference play and with some help they have an outside shot at winning their division. I expect Charlotte to come out strong, fade quickly, and just try to get out of Knoxville healthy. Vols roll on homecoming, and set their sights on the remaining SEC schedule
