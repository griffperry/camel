Noah Taylor: Kentucky 17, Tennessee 13

(Season: 7-2)

I’m not overly confident in this pick because I think this is another game that could end up going either way. 

I am, however confident in this game being low scoring and coming down to turnovers and defense. Kentucky’s defense is one of the best in the SEC-let alone the country-which doesn’t bode well for a Tennessee offensive line that appears to be more of a liability every week.

While both offenses are far from potent, Kentucky gets the edge in the run game and the defense which I think leads to their first win in Neyland Stadium since 1984.
