Evan Winter: Tennessee 27, Charlotte 7

(Season: 6-2)

I really don’t know how this game is going to go to be honest. If Tennessee comes out and presses the issue, this game will be over early.

However, if the defense plays like it did last week and if the offense continues to commit penalties like they did against South Carolina, then you can toss every point spread out the window.

It’s still uncertain how the offensive line will perform and if they can have a repeat performance per the Gamecocks. If the defense has another bad game then all hope may be lost for that side of the ball.

Regardless, the Vols should march one step closer toward a bowl game on Saturday.
