Kentucky has a plus-1 turnover margin for the season, but the Wildcats have made their share of mistakes along the way. They have committed multiple turnovers in four games this season, including two of their past three games, and quarterback Terry Wilson has been inconsistent as a passer at times. I expect Tennessee to sell out to stop the run, much like Kentucky’s last two opponents, Missouri and Georgia, which both held the Wildcats to fewer than 100 rushing yards. I expect the Vols’ aggressive approach to pay off with at least two turnovers in a low-scoring game that easily could be decided by a big play on defense or special teams. — Ryan Callahan
