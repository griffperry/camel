Noah Taylor: Tennessee 41, ETSU 7

(Season: 1-0)

The Bucs making the trip down from Johnson City offer a much needed tune up game for Tennessee following a 40-14 thumping at the hands of West Virginia last Saturday. 

This one should present an opportunity for the Vols to work out some kinks and get their first win of the Jeremy Pruitt era in convincing fashion. Really, the only storyline here is Randy Sanders’ return to Knoxville. I don’t think he’ll be walking back to the tri-cities naked when it’s all said and done.
