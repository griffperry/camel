Tennessee’s sophomore kicker will connect on four field goals Saturday against Kentucky. I say this because of the offensive struggles that everyone assumes is on the way against the Wildcats and because Cimaglia quietly made four field goals in the 29-26 loss at Kentucky last season. And he only made eight field goals the entire season.  Cimaglia is 8-for-11 this season, with a long of 45. He went 3-for-4 at Auburn in the upset at Jordan-Hare Stadium. Add four more to the total Saturday in another upset and start making ‘Cimaglia the Real MVP’ memes. — Grant Ramey
