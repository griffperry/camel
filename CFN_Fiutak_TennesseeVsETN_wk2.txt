One Reason Why East Tennessee State Will Win
The Bucs had a good quarterback who won’t buckle under the pressure. Logan Marchi is a Temple transfer who has seen his share of time, and he looked the part with a terrific 273-yard, three touchdown performance against Mars Hill.

Dealing with Tennessee in Neyland is a little bit different than handling the Lions, but coming off a miserable day against West Virginia, the Vol secondary might be a little rattled.

Hope the ETSU run defense can live behind the line like it did last week, get an efficient day out of Marchi, hope the Vol offense can’t find any sort of a groove – again.

That’s all possible.

One Reason Why Tennessee Will Win
It’s not that Jarrett Guarantano was awful against West Virginia, but the offense just couldn’t make anything happen down the field.

He hit 17-of-25 passes for 172 yards and a score, and Tim Jordan and the ground game had a few nice moments, but now the explosion has to come.

Defensively, the Vols will get to Marchi and pressure him all game long – Marchi isn’t Will Grier – and there’s a chance the offense finally finds something it can consistently do well.

There’s talent and upside on the Tennessee attack – it just needs a spark. the D coming up with several takeaways should do that. ETSU gave it up three times last week.

What’s Going To Happen
No, East Tennessee State isn’t going to make this a game, but Tennessee won’t look like a world beater quite yet, either.

The offense will go on a few early scoring drives to ease any tension, but it’ll take a while to pull away. There won’t be any stress – the defense will make sure of that – but the fan base won’t quite get the cathartic offensive explosion it desperately needs until late.
