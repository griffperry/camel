I think we all know last week’s loss to Florida was an opportunity that Tennessee missed. Turnovers were the only way either of those teams was going to blow out the other, and the Vols turned it over an incredible six times. That was a winnable game, and Tennessee made too many mistakes to even give itself a chance.

This game is just … well … probably not winnable.

I never say never in a series that has featured so many underdog performances to remember, but when you look at these matchups, it just … well … it doesn’t look good.

Tennessee normally could take solace in the fact that Georgia has a surprisingly anemic pass rush. But … well … we’ve seen these Vols try to block opposing defenses.

Even if you want to imagine a scenario where Tennessee makes some big plays early to quiet the crowd and gain confidence … well … these Vols haven’t scored a first-quarter offensive touchdown this season.

No matter which way you look at this one, … well … it doesn’t look good. GEORGIA 52, TENNESSEE 14
