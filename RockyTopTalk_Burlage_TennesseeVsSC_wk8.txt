Austin Burlage: South Carolina 31, Tennessee 20

(Season: 6-1)

This is a game I had circled since the start of the season. I really felt like the Gamecocks were over-hyped heading into this season, and this would be a great chance for an improving Vols team to sneak away from Columbia with a win. So far, it seems like these predictions have been accurate. South Carolina has lost each of their games against ranked opponents, and were even edged out by Missouri at home. The Vols have certainly improved each week of the season, with a recent upset road win against Auburn serving as proof.

The problem? Tennessee just got unfortunate news that may lead to a significant regression. Unfortunately, Trey Smith will be out indefinitely (and we all hope for a speedy and complete recovery). A newly constructed offensive line with a short amount of time to prepare for an SEC defense on the road is not promising. I’m expecting a gigantic effort to come up just a bit short.
