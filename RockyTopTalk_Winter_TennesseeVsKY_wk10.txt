Evan Winter: Tennessee 21, Kentucky 20

(Season: 7-2)

Here we go. I haven’t picked the Vols to win an SEC game in almost a year, but this one feels different for some reason.

Tennessee needs to stop two players: Josh Allen and Benny Snell Jr. While that’s easier said than done, Pruitt and Helton have shown they can come up with competent game plans.

The Vols avoid losing to Kentucky in consecutive years and get one step closer to a bowl game this weekend.
