Noah Taylor: Auburn 27, Tennessee 14

(Season: 4-1)

The Auburn Tigers — who, believe it or not, entered 2018 as a potential playoff contender — are reeling right now after dropping their second game of the season in a 23-9 loss at Mississippi State last week. 

All of the sudden, a game that was just one in a daunting stretch that loomed all offseason now doesn’t look as intimidating. This Auburn team is beatable.

That being said, I like the Tigers at home pulling away late to top the Vols in what will be a close game throughout.
