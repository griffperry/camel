One reason Tennessee is going to win
What happened to the auburn running game?
From 2013 through the first three games of this season – a wingspan of 70 games – Tigers ran for less than 100 feet in just four games, losing four.
Auburn failed to reach the 100 Yard mark in each of his last three games, but he managed to win twice.
The defensive front of Tennessee was not a rock-battling on the last two games against Florida and Georgia-but the offensive line of Auburn is having an even harder time.
Auburn doesn't control the clock, the attack doesn't make most of its chances, and there was a big problem with escaping and sanctions.
Vols need all the help they can get.
There have been a lot of problems, but they don't get hurt with sanctions, and they don't have a lot of problems with turnover. But...
A reason why Auburn will win
Tennessee's offensive line is in trouble.
Vols allow far too many tracks behind the line – it's easy to get into the back field on a regular basis, especially on the third downs – and looks for an offense that has trouble getting something going.
For all the troubles in Auburn. The defence is part of the pressure production and keeps the team in the games. It's just giving up an average of 14 points per game, mainly because it is to get out of the field.
Auburn allowed teams to convert 40% of three or more chances into two games-losses at State University and Mississippi. The teams were under the sign of 40% in the tiger's four victories.
Tennessee converted to just 36% of the third attempt at Down.
What's going to happen
With two weeks off to reload the batteries, the Auburn offense will come with some good first scoring discs, and then the defense will take care of the rest.
Tigers won't come up with huge offensive performance, but they'll go ahead and stay there. The crime in Tennessee will not hold the defensive front of Auburn outside the field-the pressure will come in waves.
