Noah Taylor: Tennessee 48, Charlotte 14

(Season: 6-2)

After that monumental win at Auburn three weeks ago, back-to-back losses to Alabama and South Carolina dealt a serious blow to Tennessee’s chances of bowl eligibility. The 49ers are coming at an opportune time as the Vols need three more wins to reach the post season for the first time since 2016.

I don’t expect Tennessee to be looking ahead to Kentucky and should roll in this one, before going into a crucial three-game stretch to close out the regular season.
