Austin Burlage: Tennessee 38, UTEP 6

(Season: 2-0)

The Vols handled ETSU last week, and look to do the same this week to a struggling UTEP team. I don’t think Tennessee will get as much help scoring this week from the defense and special teams as they did last week against an FCS opponent. Still a blow-out, and Tennessee wins comfortably. But Tennessee still has some concerns along the offensive and defensive lines that I don’t think will be resolved by Saturday afternoon. This one might be really close to that 31-point line Tennessee was favored by earlier this week (you know, if you’re into that sort of thing).
