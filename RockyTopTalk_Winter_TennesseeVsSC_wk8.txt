Evan Winter: South Carolina 20, Tennessee 12

(Season: 5-2)

I was very confident heading into this game despite South Carolina coming off a bye week. However, I’m not sure how the Vols will on offense without Trey Smith.

His loss is a big deal, there is no hiding it. The good news is that he missed all of spring and fall camp, so whoever takes his place will most likely have practiced with this group before.

I need to see what this offense can do without Smith before I pick the Vols to win any games.
