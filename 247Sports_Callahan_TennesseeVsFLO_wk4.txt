If you had asked me before the season, I would have included a Tennessee win over Florida in my prediction of a 6-6 season for the Vols. If you had asked me after their uninspired 24-0 shutout of UTEP last week, I would have picked Florida to win this game.

Now I’m torn, convinced this game probably will be a lot like the nail-biters these two teams have had in three of their past four meetings.

Neither team is particularly strong on either side of the ball, which makes a lot of the most important matchups look like weakness-on-weakness. And two of the areas where I see slight advantages for the two teams — Jarrett Guarantano has been more consistently reliable for Tennessee than Florida quarterback Feleipe Franks, while the Vols’ shaky offensive line could struggle against the Gators’ pass rush — might cancel each other out to some degree.

It’s an enormously important game for both teams. The winner could play its way into a bowl game that could represent an important step forward for either first-year Florida coach Dan Mullen or first-year Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt. The loser might struggle to win an SEC game this season. Because of that, I expect both teams to play with plenty of desperation.

Either way, look for this game to be decided in the fourth quarter. It might come down to a turnover, although both teams have done a reasonably good job of taking care of the ball so far this year. But I see Guarantano continuing his steady play and being the difference in this game, pulling out a much-needed, signature win against one of the Vols’ main rivals. TENNESSEE 24, FLORIDA 20
