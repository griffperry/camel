Noah Taylor: Alabama 45, Tennessee 21

(Season: 4-2)


While Tennessee had that program-defining win at Auburn last Saturday, in the back of everyone’s minds was this matchup with top-ranked Alabama looming large. 

Auburn wasn’t a game Jeremy Pruitt had to win in year one, but it was a game they needed to play well in and they exceeded expectations for many. But now comes Crimson Tide, and the results this time are going to be very different. And for Tennessee, that’s okay. Whatever the result is on Saturday in Neyland Stadium, it won’t be indicative of the direction the program under Jeremy Pruitt is heading. 

While the SEC as whole may be the best overall it has been in years, no one in this conference is beating Goliath this season, and that may go for the rest of the country as well.
