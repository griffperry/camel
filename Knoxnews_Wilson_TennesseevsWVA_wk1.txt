West Virginia 34, Tennessee 16: West Virginia has an explosive passing attack, led by quarterback Will Grier. Tennessee has a brand-new group of cornerbacks. That’s not an ideal situation for the Vols in Jeremy Pruitt’s debut. However, I expect this game to be more competitive than I did a couple months ago. West Virginia still has too many weapons to bet against, though.
