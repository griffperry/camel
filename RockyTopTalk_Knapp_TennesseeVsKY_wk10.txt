Conner Knapp: Tennessee 20, Kentucky 17

(Season: 7-2)

This is the toughest game I’ve had to pick this year. Kentucky is No. 11 in the country, and yet somehow feels like Tennessee’s most likely win remaining on its schedule.

Tennessee is going to have to find some way to contain Kentucky linebacker Josh Allen, but I believe Jeremy Pruitt will have a game plan to stop Benny Snell and force Kentucky to throw the ball if it is going to beat the Vols.
