There is little doubt about the outcome of this game. UTEP is on a 14-game losing streak and in 2018 lost by 20 points to a middling FCS team and by 28 points to a middling Mountain West team that needed all of six completed passes to score 52 points. The Miners should offer little resistance.

In a game like this it's more about the performance than the result for Tennessee, and the Vols have plenty of things they need to figure out before the Florida game and the start of their SEC gauntlet.

Can this offensive line start better and eliminate the worrying signs it showed in the first two games? Will Tennessee's offense again look more like Tyson Helton said it would with a physical run game paired with downfield shots in the passing game? Is this the week the Vols finally find a pass rush? Can Tennessee have a third game turnover-free game on offense and continue to be opportunistic on defense? Is another big play on special teams coming?

How Tennessee addresses those questions on Saturday will assuredly be more important than the final score. TENNESSEE 63, UTEP 14
