Terry Lambert: Alabama 48, Tennessee 16

(Season: 4-2)

That score I just posted has very little to do with Tennessee. Alabama is just a true juggernaut. They jump out to huge leads, racking up points and yards no matter who is on the other side of the ball.

Tennessee took a massive step forward last week, but this is a much different story. I’m expecting Jarrett Guarantano to make a play or two against a beatable secondary, but it won’t be enough. Nick Saban has the best offense in the country and that should absolutely terrify everyone.
