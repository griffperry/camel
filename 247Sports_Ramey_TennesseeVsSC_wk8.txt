Is anything more motivating for a player than going back home and trying to beat the hometown team you were once committed to? That’s the scenario Saturday night when Tennessee freshman defensive back Bryce Thompson will face South Carolina at Williams-Bryce Stadium in Columbia. The Irmo, S.C., native, a product of Dutch Fork High School, was committed to the Gamecocks from December to March, reopening his commitment in March. By the end of May he was enrolling at Tennessee and through seven games this season he has accounted for 21 tackles, 2.0 tackles for loss and a team-high two interceptions. By the close of business Saturday, he’ll have six more tackles, another tackle for loss and another interception. — Grant Ramey
