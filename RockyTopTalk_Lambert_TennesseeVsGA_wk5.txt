Terry Lambert: Georgia 45, Tennessee 13

(Season: 3-1)

Welcome to the stretch of Hell. We stared at this Georgia-Auburn-Alabama stretch all summer long and it might even look worse now as we are just hours away. Georgia is going to put a different level of athlete on the field on Saturday afternoon and should breeze through this one.

None of this is on Jeremy Pruitt or this staff. The talent just isn’t in Knoxville yet. Better days are ahead, but we may be getting ready to see the bottom fall out one final time.
