Terry Lambert: Tennessee 17, Florida 16

(Season: 3-0)

I told myself to never pick the Vols in this series again, at least until Tennessee proves to be competent once again. But here I am, coming back for more.

Pruitt seems confident in the week that his team has had on the practice field and I think Neyland will be absolutely rocking on Saturday.

It’s going to be an ugly one, but I think the Vols — specifically Jarrett Guarantano — find a way to get this one done.
