Perhaps the biggest storyline for Tennessee this week was the position change of freshman Jeremy Banks from running back to linebacker. It's a move the excitable Banks first requested with Tennessee's coaches actually during the fourth quarter of the Georgia game on Sept. 29. The Vols finally relented and gave Banks his wish this week. Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt on Wednesday first said Banks "possibly could play" on defense against South Carolina, citing Tennessee's defensive simplicity, but after practice that day he sort of backtracked. "Obviously he’s practiced for three days on defense, so it’s not probably — you know, he probably don’t have a whole lot of knowledge of what we’re trying to get done," Pruitt said. Tennessee certainly needs a spark at inside linebacker given the play there this season, and Banks was getting plenty of reps alongside the rotation players during scout-team periods on Wednesday. Banks may not know what to do, but the Vols should just throw him in there and have him blitz just to see what happens. Why not? — Patrick Brown
