Noah Taylor: Tennessee 53, UTEP 13

(Season: 2-0)

UTEP may be the worst FBS team Tennessee will play this season. The Miners are 0-2 after dropping their opener to FCS Northern Arizona, 30-10 and then again getting routed last week at the hands of UNLV, 52-24. 

The Vols should cruise to 2-1 before opening the SEC slate with the always-important Florida game in Neyland next Saturday.
