Back in June, one of the bold predictions I made for Tennessee's 2018 season was the Vols would beat Florida. I'm not going to back out now. Part of it is sticking to my guns, but even without the precedent I set in the summer I would take the Vols to win.

The Gators haven't shown me anything that would make me backtrack on the stance Tennessee would win this game. I thought these teams were almost mirror images of each other in many ways and the first three weeks have proven that to be the case. There are plenty of question marks on both sides of the ball for both teams, and that's why both programs have new coaches.

This is the epitome of a toss-up game because the weaknesses for each team kind of match up with each other. Tennessee's secondary is shaky, but Florida quarterback Feleipe Franks is hard to trust. The Gators were run over by Kentucky, but can this feast-or-famine Tennessee offensive line get the job done? I think the Vols finally play loose in this series and what should be an electric atmosphere will push the Vols over the line. TENNESSEE 24, FLORIDA 17
