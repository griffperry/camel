Austin Burlage: Alabama 35, Tennessee 10

(Season: 5-1)

Last week I was totally wrong, in the best way possible. The Tennessee offense managed to come alive after several weeks in SEC play to propel the Vols to an excellent win against an SEC-West foe. I’m coming around on the Vols offense. The problem - we run into one of the best college football teams of all time this week in the Alabama Crimson Tide. Let’s face it, it’ll probably be ugly. But, maybe it won’t be that bad. Here are some reasons why.

For one, we’ve got home field advantage. It probably won’t be quite as intimidating as in prior iterations of this rivalry given the circumstances, but Neyland remains a difficult place to play. For two, we have Jeremy Pruitt. Alabama pretty much has no weak points, but if they did have a “less good” area Coach Pruitt will know it given his background with the Alabama program. Third, and most importantly, the Crimson Tide have huge games coming up. Alabama will play at #5 LSU, home against #22 Mississippi State, and home in the Iron Bowl over the next four weeks. Tennessee is a classic trap opponent! An improving team playing at home with nothing to lose as their opponent looks ahead to seemingly more meaningful games. I’m not crazy enough to think the Vols will win, but they can keep it close. Especially if Tua Tagovailoa’s health is in question
