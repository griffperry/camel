Why this isn't bold: Charlotte isn't very good on special teams. The 49ers rank 12th in Conference USA in punt coverage, last in the league in kickoff coverage and 118th nationally in net punting. Charlotte allowed a punt-return touchdown against Appalachian State and kickoff-return touchdown against UMass. Why this is bold: Tennessee's return game has been largely MIA this season. The Vols have only nine punt returns and 12 kick returns in eight games this season and often have opted for fair catches on kickoffs. It's also bold because top kick returner Ty Chandler is iffy for this game and Charlotte's punting issues likely won't allow Marquez Callaway many quality opportunities in the punt-return game. However, this is the kind of game where Tennessee's overall talent advantage could show up on special teams, meaning the Vols could have a breakout in the return game or block another punt for a touchdown. — Patrick Brown
