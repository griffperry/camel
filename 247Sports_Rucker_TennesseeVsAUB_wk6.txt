There are so many interesting things about this game, and many of them have little to do with Tennessee.

Where is Auburn psychologically after its second loss in a season that began with championship aspirations? Will Jordan-Hare Stadium have any juice for an 11 a.m. local kickoff? What matters more: Tennessee head coach Jeremy Pruitt and his staff having so much experience against Auburn and this specific offense, or Tennessee’s current players never having faced this unique scheme? Can Auburn put together the pieces on its struggling offense?

You don’t have to be bullish on this Tennessee team to hold out something resembling realistic hope that the Vols can hang in there and give themselves a chance against the Tigers. Auburn’s offense has been in neutral for a while, and Tennessee’s defense isn’t dynamic but has done a reasonable job keeping opponents in front of it and preventing big plays. If Auburn fails to rack up points against these Vols, then these Vols will be just a play or two away from making things really interesting in this game. That’s not crazy. It’s common sense.

Here’s where I am, though: I just think Auburn has a better team. I think Auburn’s defense is pretty darn good, and that one rough game against a unique Mississippi State offense with a unique quarterback hasn’t changed that. I don’t think Auburn needs to play its best football to win this game, and I think Tennessee needs to be at (or near) its best and hope for the Tigers to be sloppy and make some mistakes. I don’t expect this to be an exciting game. I expect Auburn to go out there and clock in for a decent shift and a businesslike win. AUBURN 27, TENNESSEE 13
