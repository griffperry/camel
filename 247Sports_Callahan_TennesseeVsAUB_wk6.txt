If you were drawing up a scenario for Tennessee to pull an upset against a ranked opponent this season, it would look a lot like the circumstances surrounding this game.

Auburn, a team with a struggling offense and reportedly with some turmoil behind the scenes, will play host to the Vols for a late-morning kickoff before a crowd that could become restless pretty quickly if the Tigers stumble out of the gates. Auburn is coming off a two-touchdown loss in which it struggled on both sides of the ball, while Tennessee has had two weeks to prepare for the Tigers.

It’s always possible that Auburn’s loss last week could serve as a wake-up call of sorts for the Tigers, who already have lost two games this season and still have a couple of tougher tests awaiting later this season against Georgia and Alabama. If they don’t start to turn things around now, their season quickly could spiral out of control.

Aside from that, though, the only downside about this matchup for the Vols is that it’s still a tough one on paper. Auburn has struggled to run the ball this year but still has plenty of talent on offense, and the Tigers’ defense is one of the best Tennessee will face this season. Even after allowing 349 rushing yards last week at Mississippi State, Auburn is ranked in the top 10 nationally in scoring defense and in the top 20 nationally in total defense.

This should be the Vols’ best chance so far this year to put up a fight for 60 minutes against a Power Five opponent, and it’s likely to be a good barometer for how the rest of their season will go. I expect them to keep it competitive into the second half, but Auburn still has too much talent and eventually will pull away. AUBURN 27, TENNESSEE 10
