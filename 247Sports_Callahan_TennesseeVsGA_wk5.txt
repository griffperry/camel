Tennessee’s loss to Florida last week was demoralizing for the Vols for multiple reasons, not the least of which is the brutal stretch of SEC games that awaits them over the next few weeks.

Simply put, Tennessee needed a win against Florida to offset the damage the the Vols are likely to endure against Georgia, Auburn and Alabama — and perhaps even against South Carolina after that — and to give themselves a legitimate chance at playing their way into a bowl game. It’s now harder to envision the Vols doing that this year, and it’s fair to wonder whether they will go winless in SEC play for the second consecutive year.

Tennessee isn’t good enough to beat Georgia. Even if the Vols don’t commit six turnovers the way they did last week in their 47-21 loss to the Gators, they’ll have a hard time matching up with the Bulldogs, who took Alabama to overtime in last year’s national championship game and look capable of returning to the College Football Playoff this year.

the Vols’ offense doesn’t seem capable of scoring enough points for a potential upset. And Tennessee’s defense will be tested this week, to say the least, by Georgia’s balanced offense, led by a strong running game that’s averaging 250.3 rushing yards per game this season.

The next few games for the Vols likely will be more about how they play more so than just whether they win. Their odds of knocking off Georgia are slim at best. But they can do a better job of protecting Jarrett Guarantano, take better care of the ball, run the ball better, show they’re capable of slowing down a powerful running game and force some turnovers on defense. GEORGIA 45, TENNESSEE 13
