Noah Taylor: South Carolina 24, Tennessee 19

(Season: 5-2)

Like both of these programs, I am fighting for bowl eligibility in my picks this season and that’s why I’m going with the Gamecocks.

Like Conner, the loss of Trey Smith on already struggling offensive line is going to have an impact on a Tennessee offense that took a beating versus Alabama last week. 

While Keller Chryst looked promising after tossing for two touchdowns, coming in after Jarrett Guarantano went down in the 2nd quarter, the quarterback position will also be one to look out for if the line cannot protect whoever is the signal caller on Saturday night.
