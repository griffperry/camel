It’s been a while since Dana Dimel did this head coaching thing.
After three good years at Wyoming in the late 1990s, he had a rough run at Houston going 8-26 before being let go after the 2002 season. The former Kansas State offensive coordinator under Bill Snyder took his old job back in 2009, and he was a part of the program’s resurgence.

Now he gets to see what a real rebuilding job is like.

He’s getting a shot to turn around a program that’s known just one winning season since 2005, and is coming off a year as the worst team in college football scoring just 141 points in an 0-12 season.

How bad was it? The 15-14 loss to Western Kentucky was the only game the Miners didn’t drop by at least 17 points.

Dimel knows what a winless season is like, going 0-11 at Houston in 2001. It wasn’t enough to keep his gig, but he managed a five-win improvement the following year. If he can get UTEP to five wins this season, he’ll be in the mix for Coach of the Year honors.

It all starts with an offense that completely lost its way – and that’s where Dimel should be able to change things around.

UTEP scored more in the final four games of the 2016 season than it did all of last year. Now, if nothing else, the attack will start to push the ball down the field more, will get more dynamic play out of the skill spots, and it should start to be more fun.
