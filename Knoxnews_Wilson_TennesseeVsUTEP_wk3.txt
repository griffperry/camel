Tennessee football posted offensive numbers like it hasn’t seen since 2016 on Saturday against UTEP.

At least, it tallied total yardage and rushing yardage that hadn’t been seen in almost two years. The scoreboard was a different tale.

“When you say 24 points, not where we want to be — absolutely not,” Vols coach Jeremy Pruitt said. “Then you look at what the result of it — way too many penalties and turning the ball over. Got to improve on that.”
The Vols (2-1) lackadaisically cruised to a 24-0 win against UTEP (0-3) on Saturday at Neyland Stadium.

They shut out the Miners and had no trouble moving the ball. Tennessee racked up 512 total yards and 345 rushing yards — the first time it eclipsed the 500-yard mark and 300-yard rushing mark since the end of the 2016 season.

But Pruitt bemoaned poor practices and issues with penalties and turnovers that the Vols hadn’t faced in his tenure. UT finished with two turnovers and a season-high eight penalties for 65 yards.

Twice in the first half, UT reached the red zone only to commit untimely penalties and a turnover to take points off the board.

“It’s always frustrating, especially when we put together good drives and really get down the field,” wide receiver Brandon Johnson said. “We put together great drives and shoot ourselves in the foot. That’s frustrating.”
