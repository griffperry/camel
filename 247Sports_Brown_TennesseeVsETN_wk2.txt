The occasion should be the story more so than the game on Saturday.

A little more than three years ago, ETSU was playing (and losing) to Division III College Maryville College in its second game back as a football program. Now the Bucs will be playing in front of almost 100,000 people at Neyland Stadium. That will be a really cool experience for those players and the folks in Johnson City who have helped bring the program back with a new stadium and an attendance figure of more than 8,500 last week.

The game should be pretty straightforward, as all of Tennessee's recent games against FCS opposition have been. The average score of those games has been Vols 49, FCS opponents 8, but at least this time Tennessee is keeping things within the state.

But with this team coming off the West Virginia loss, it's more about the performance than the score, because I think this staff will want to leave Neyland Stadium on Saturday night hoping to have a better idea of this team's strengths and weaknesses.

Jeremy Pruitt will pick up his first win but I think he might take it easy on friend Randy Sanders.
