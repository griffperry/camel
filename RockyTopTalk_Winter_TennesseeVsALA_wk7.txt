Evan Winter: Alabama 35, Tennessee 20

(Season: 4-2)

Well, that was fun while it lasted.

Last week’s win cannot be understated, but neither can this week’s matchup against a far superior team.

This is the best team Nick Saban has had since he arrived in Tuscaloosa and this is probably the worst team Jeremy Pruitt will have during his time in Knoxville.

The stars won’t align for this one, but expect the Vols to put up a decent fight.
