Alabama will not score a touchdown on its opening drive. This is the definition of bold, because Alabama remarkably has scored a touchdown on its opening series in all seven games this season. The Tide's first touchdowns have come with 11:55, 13:19, 13:39, 14:10, 11:25, 14:39 and 14:37 left on the first-quarter clock. Those scoring plays include Tua Tagovailoa touchdown passes of 58, 30, 76 and 81 yards and a touchdown run of 43 yards. Alabama scored on its first offensive snap against Arkansas and Texas A&M, its second against Arkansas and third against Ole Miss. In other words, it'd be a major upset if Tennessee survived the first five minutes of the game. The Vols allowed opening-drive touchdowns to both Georgia and Auburn. So yeah ... this is outlandishly bold. — Patrick Brown
