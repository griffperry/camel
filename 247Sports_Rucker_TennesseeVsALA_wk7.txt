I don't think there's any question that Alabama will win this game comfortably, but I think Tennessee head coach Jeremy Pruitt knows this Alabama team pretty well, and I think he'll be able to draw up a couple of things to give the Tide issues. I think that one those things will force Tua Tagovailoa's first interception of the season. Tagovailoa has been battling a sore knee and looked much more human-like last week even before aggravating that knee injury, so it'll be interesting to see if that remains an issue in this game. Either way, I think he'll toss his first interception of the season in this game. I think Alabama will win this game and this season's national championship, and I think Tagovailoa will win the Heisman Trophy, but I think he'll throw a pick in this game. -Wes Rucker
