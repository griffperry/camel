One reason why Tennessee will win
What happened to the Auburn running game?
From 2013 to the first three games of this season, a series of 70 games, the Tigers ran for less than 100 yards in four games, losing all four.
Auburn failed to reach the 100-yard rushing mark in each of his last three games, but managed to win twice.
The defensive front of Tennessee has not been a rock, fighting in the last two games against Florida and Georgia, but the Auburn offensive line is having an even more difficult time.
Auburn does not control the clock, the offense does not make the most of its possibilities and there has been a big problem with loose balls and penalties.
Vols need all the help they can get.
There have been a lot of problems, but they are not hurting themselves with penalties, and they are not having as much trouble with the turnovers. But â€¦
One reason why Auburn will win
The Tennessee offensive line is fighting.
The Vols are allowing too many plays behind the line (it is easy to enter the backfield on a regular basis, especially in the third chances) and is showing an offense that has trouble making something work.
For all Auburn's problems. The defense is doing its part to generate pressure and keep the team in the games. He is only giving up an average of 14 points per game, mainly because he is leaving the field.
Auburn has allowed teams to convert 40% of their third down or more chances in two games: losses to LSU and the state of Mississippi. Teams have been below 40% in Tiger's four victories.
Tennessee is converting only 36% of their third-try attempts.
What is going to happen
With two weeks off to recharge the batteries, the Auburn offense will produce some good early scoring units, and then the defense will take care of the rest.
The Tigers will not have a giant offensive performance, but they will go ahead and stay there. The Tennessee offense will not keep Auburn's defensive front off the field, the pressure will come in waves.
