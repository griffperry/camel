Jarrett Guarantano left Saturday's game against Florida after a suspect hit in the third quarter.

The Tennessee quarterback was standing in the pocket after throwing an incomplete pass to Josh Palmer when UF defensive end CeCe Jefferson hit Guarantano's knee. Guarantano left the field and went to the injury tent on the sideline.

Vols coach Jeremy Pruitt said he expects Guarantano to be fine.

"Jarrett is tough," Pruitt said after UT's 47-21 loss. "I knew that when I came here. He is learning on the go and he is maturing. I think he is a guy that is going to be a really good quarterback one day. I like the way he is growing into it. We got to give the guy a chance a little bit. He can’t take as many hits when he’s not looking. I thought tonight he got rid of the ball on time. … We just got to keep them off of him.”

The sophomore was 7 of 18 for 164 yards with two interceptions and a fumble against the Gators.

Senior Keller Chryst came in to replace Guarantano and led the Vols on a scoring drive.
