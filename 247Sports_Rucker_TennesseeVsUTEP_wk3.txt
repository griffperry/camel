I feel for UTEP. I mean … it’s getting a nice paycheck for this weekend, but I still feel for the UTEP players.

You’ve lost 14 games in a row, and now you have to go play at Neyland Stadium? Gross.

There’s at least an adequate argument to be made that UTEP is the worst team in NCAA Division I FBS football. This Tennessee team isn’t great. Far from it. It has plenty of holes. But UTEP is in bad, bad shape. I don’t expect this to be much different from Tennessee’s win last weekend over NCAA Division I FCS program East Tennessee State.

At least UTEP is getting paid for this, right? Right? TENNESSEE 55, UTEP 10
