Final Grades: Tennessee vs West Virginia
A bad performance that holds a sliver of hope
Whew, that was rough.

After holding West Virginia to 13 points in the first half, the Vols allowed 27 second-half points en route to a 40-14 blowout. Most believed it would be a rough outing for Tennessee and they were correct.

How did they grade out? Let’s dive into 2018’s first evaluation.

Offense
From the very first play, things got off to a bad start for the offense and didn’t get much better as the game went on. They managed just 4.8 yards per play in Charlotte.

That isn’t going to win many games against offenses such as West Virginia - or many games at all.

Six penalties for 48 yards also killed drives that could’ve kept Will Grier and the offense off of the field, which the Vols lost 40-14 in part because of that.
It will be interesting to see if the Mountaineers’ defense actually improved that much from last season or if the Vols were really that dysfunctional. The play calling was also very suspect at times, but there will be more on that later.

No turnovers is a plus, but I’d rather score 35 points with a couple of mistakes than 14 with none.

Overall, 14 points isn’t good and won’t win games when the defense plays like it did. At least there is some tape to watch of the two touchdown drives. The Vols looked very good driving down the field and that should be a great building block - but for now, there is a lot of work that remains to be done.

Final Grade: 1.5 (D)
