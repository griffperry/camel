Jarrett Guarantano leaves Alabama game with upper-body injury. Jarrett Guarantano left Tennessee's game against No. 1 Alabama with an injury Saturday and is out for the rest of the game, CBS reported.

The Vols sophomore quarterback took a vicious hit from Crimson Tide linebacker Mack Wilson in the second quarter. He remained down on the field and UT's training stuff rushed to his aide.

He walked off under his own power, remained on the sideline for a stretch and then retreated to the locker room. CBS reported that Guarantano was having his collarbone area evaluated and he would not return. Keller Chryst came in to replace Guarantano and threw a touchdown to Ty Chandler in that same drive. UT trailed 28-0 when Guarantano left the game.

He was 5 of 10 for 63 yards passing when he left. He gained 30 of those yards on the play that knocked him out of the game, as he connected with Josh Palmer on the sideline.

Palmer also left the game with an injury on the same play.
