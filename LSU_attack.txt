One reason why Tennessee will win
What happened to the Auburn running game?
From 2013 through the first three games this season - a series of 70 games - the Tigers raced for less than 100 yards in just four games, losing all four games.
Auburn failed to hit the 100-yard mark in his last three games, but managed to win twice.
Tennessee's defensive front has not been a tough one - in the last two games against Florida and Georgia - but the Auburn offensive line is going through an even more difficult period.
Auburn is not checking the clock, the offense is not making the most of his chances, and there was a big problem with fumble and penalties.
The Vols need all the help they can get.
There have been a lot of problems, but they do not get hurt with penalties and they do not have a lot of trouble with the turnovers. But ...
One reason that Auburn will win
The Tennessee offensive line is in trouble.
The Vols are allowing too many plays behind the line - it's easy to get into the backfield on a regular basis, especially the third down - and it's proving an offense that's having trouble getting everything done.
For all the problems of Auburn. the defense is playing its part in generating pressure and keeping the team in the games. He only waives an average of 14 points per game, mainly because he is coming down from the field.
Auburn has allowed the teams to convert 40% of their third or more odds into two games: losses for LSU and Mississippi. The teams have been under the sign of 40% in the four wins of Tiger.
Tennessee is converting only 36% of its third attempts.
What's going to happen
With two weeks off to recharge the batteries, the Auburn offense will come with some good initial bets, and then the defense will take care of the rest.
The Tigers will not produce a giant offensive performance, but will go on and stay there. The Tennessee attack will not keep the Auburn defensive front off the backfield - the pressure will come in waves.
