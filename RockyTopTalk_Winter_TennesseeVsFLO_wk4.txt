Per usual, this game is a toss-up. But I feel more comfortable with Florida’s loss to Kentucky than I do the Vols’ loss to West Virginia.

I just don’t think this team nor staff is ready for SEC play. While the defense has improved, Tyson Helton seems like he is still figuring things out.

The key is the offensive line and the home crowd, but I don’t think the Vols play consistent enough to win.
