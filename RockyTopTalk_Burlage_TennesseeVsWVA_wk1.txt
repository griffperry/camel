Austin Burlage: West Virginia 34, Tennessee 24

My heart says Tennessee has a shot — a really good shot — to win this game. On paper the Vols match up extremely well. In terms of athletes, Tennessee absolutely has the players to compete with West Virginia.

But my gut says this game simply comes too early in the season. If Tennessee and West Virginia were to meet in a bowl game I think it would be Vols by double digits. This isn’t just a new scheme Tennessee is breaking in, though. It is an entirely new philosophy as a football program, a total reverse of the way things have been done from a football standpoint in recent memory.

The Mountaineers are a well oiled machine offensively. And, although their defense was largely poor a season ago, they will be familiar with their system and return many experienced players. Tennessee will compete, and I expect the improvement between 2017 and 2018 to be evident. At the end of this one I’ll just be happy if the talking points don’t revolve around the Tennessee sideline hoisting a trash can in the air for four hours.
