Noah Taylor: West Virginia 41, Tennessee 28

West Virginia is capable of scoring a lot, but I think Tennessee will be able to hang with the Mountaineers-for most of the game.

I have this one close going into the fourth quarter, but West Virginia will score a pair of touchdowns late to put it away. Still, in a game that close, there’s not going to be a whole lot of room for error and I could still see it going either way. If Jeremy Pruitt has the defense performing at a high level (pressure on Grier, forcing them to turn to the ground game), a mistake or two by West Virginia could go a long way in Tennessee getting a big upset in week one.

I’m going with the Mountaineers, but I would not be surprised with a different result that favors the Vols.
