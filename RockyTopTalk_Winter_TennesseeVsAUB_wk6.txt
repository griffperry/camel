Evan Winter: Auburn 25, Vols 17

(Season: 4-1)

Can Jeremy Pruitt notch his first SEC win a la Butch Jones after a bye week?

This game has all of the makings for a Tennessee upset. An early kickoff, a sputtering offense, an improving defense, and a hungry coaching staff are all working against the Tigers.

But at the end of the day, the Vols just don’t have enough to get it done.
