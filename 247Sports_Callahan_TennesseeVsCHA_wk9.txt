The junior wide receiver is Tennessee’s leader in both receptions and receiving yards this season, and he has finished with more than 50 receiving yards in five of the Vols’ first eight games this season. But he’s still waiting to score his first touchdown this year, while seven other players have caught touchdown passes, including fellow receivers Josh Palmer, Jauan Jennings, Jordan Murphy and Tyler Byrd. With Jennings expected to sit out today’s game because of an injury, I expect Callaway to play a big role in Tennessee’s passing game again and finally get into the end zone against Charlotte. — Ryan Callahan
