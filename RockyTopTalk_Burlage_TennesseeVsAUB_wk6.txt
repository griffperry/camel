Austin Burlage: Auburn 34, Tennessee 9

(Season: 5-0)

“We’re really going to open up the playbook this week because [enter reason here].”

That has been the storyline for the Vols going into both the Florida and Georgia games. And the truth is, we haven’t. I know the Vols are coming off a bye week, but my suspicion is that the team has spent much more time on the fundamentals than opening anything new up. The Auburn defensive front is an absolute force. Until proven otherwise, I don’t think we can trust the Tennessee offense to “open up” and put up any kind of big numbers on the score board.

I know much has been made about Auburn’s offense led by quarterback Jarrett Stidham. They haven’t looked good recently. To me, they look like a group that has a great deal of pride. The play calling has held them back, and in many ways appears micro-managed. I expect Auburn to get on track this Saturday. They’ll be prepared, organized, and efficient. I’ve never wanted to be more wrong, but I’ll take Auburn and I’ve got them covering (current line per Bovada has Auburn -15).
