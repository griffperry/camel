This is going to be worse than last year’s debacle.

I have no faith in this team, whatsoever. If the offensive line was just average then I’d at least expect this team to compete in the SEC. Right now, they’d have trouble winning in the Mountain West.

Georgia is at home and they are going to roll. It’s going to take a miracle to win this game and the Vols used up the one miracle they get every decade when they beat Georgia in 2016.

Remember that victory, hold it close and cherish it because it’s going to be a long time before Tennessee beats the Bulldogs again.
