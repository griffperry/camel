Let's go ahead and get this out of the way: Tennessee will win, and it shouldn't be close. East Tennessee State isn't even a very good team by FCS standards.

That said, this game will reveal some things about how the Vols will adjust to what happened Saturday against West Virginia and should give us a better idea of which newcomers and other young players might be capable of helping Tennessee during its upcoming SEC gauntlet.

If there's a healthy freshman who doesn't play in this game, it might be awhile before he sees the field. The Vols need to develop some depth on the defensive line, at cornerback, on the offensive line and even at quarterback. First-year Tennessee coach already has admitted that he plans to play backup quarterback Keller Chryst, and it might even happen pretty early in the game.

The Vols will get over their season-opening loss to West Virginia a little bit by scoring some points against the Buccaneers. More importantly, in the process, theyï¿½ll learn quite a bit about themselves. TENNESSEE 52, ETSU 7
