Conner Knapp: South Carolina 27, Tennessee 23

(Season: 5-2)

The loss of Trey Smith has a lot to do with my pick.

Tennessee is definitely good enough to win this game, but it is going to be throwing a patchwork offensive line out there for presumably the rest of the season, but certainly against a pretty good South Carolina team on the road at night.

I think the Vols will need a great defensive performance to beat the Gamecocks and I’m just not sure they get it.
