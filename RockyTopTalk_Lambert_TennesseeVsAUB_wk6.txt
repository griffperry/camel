Terry Lambert: Auburn 23, Tennessee 13

(Season: 4-1)

For Tennessee, they got a bye week to prepare after showing flashes against Georgia. For Auburn, they took one on the chin against Mississippi State after fighting off an upset bid in the previous week against Southern Miss.

That has created some buzz for the Vols ahead of this one. Still, Auburn’s defense is for real. Tennessee is going to struggle to move the football against just about anyone, much less a front like this. The Vols will have to steal some points on defense or special teams to really have a shot in this one. I think they’ll lack the offensive consistency needed to pull off a win.
