West Virginia 38, Tennessee 24: In the movie “The Santa Clause,” Judy the Elf tells Scott Calvin, “Seeing isn’t believing. Believing is seeing.”

It’s a cute line, but I think it’s bunk. I stick to the adage of, I’ll believe it when I see it.

That’s how I look at Tennessee entering this season. Are the Vols set to be a much-improved team in the first year of the Jeremy Pruitt era? Perhaps. But I’d like to first see some evidence against an opponent.

I know Will Grier and West Virginia’s offense are good. I’ve seen that.

I think the Vols will enjoy some success against a mediocre WVU defense but ultimately won’t keep pace.
