One of the reasons for winning in Tennessee
What happened to the Auburn running competition?
From 2013 to the first three games of the season - a total of 70 games - the Tigers ran less than 100 yards in just four games and lost all four games.
Auburn has failed to reach the 100-yard rush in the past three games, but it won twice.
In the last two games against Florida and Georgia, the Tennessee defensive front was not a boulder - but Auburn's offensive line was in a tougher time.
Auburn did not control the clock, the attack did not take full advantage of it, and there were big problems in groping and free throws.
Vols needs all the help they can get.
There have been many problems, but they have not hurt themselves because of punishment, and they have not had so many problems with mistakes. but......
A reason why Auburn will win
Tennessee's offensive line is struggling.
Vols allows too many games to be played behind the line - it's easy to enter the backcourt regularly, especially in the third game - and it shows an attacking offense.
All questions about Auburn. The defensive is working, putting pressure on the team to stay in the game. It only gives up an average of 14 points per game, mainly because it has already left.
Auburn allowed the team to convert 40% of its third turnover rate into more in two games - losing to Louisiana State University and Mississippi. In the four Tigers victory, the team's performance has been less than 40%.
Tennessee has only 36% of its third attempt to convert.
What will happen
The two-week break is charging the battery, and Auburn's offense will bring some good early scoring drives, and then the defense will take care of the rest.
The Tigers won't have a huge offensive performance, but it will lead and stay there. The Tennessee offense will not keep Auburn's defensive line away from the backcourt - the pressure will drift.
