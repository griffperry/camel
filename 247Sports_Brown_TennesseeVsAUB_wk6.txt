Auburn would appear to be ripe for the picking, but I'm not convinced Tennessee is good enough to take advantage of all that's going on with the Tigers right now. There's rumblings of internal strife coming from The Plains, Auburn's offense is a mess and there might not be much of an atmosphere at Jordan-Hare Stadium with the early kick, the students on fall break, a non-marquee opponent, this week's weather and a top-10 team taking two losses before mid-October. Those factors make this a far less daunting game than it looked a few weeks ago.

However, two things scare me about this matchup for Tennessee: Auburn's defensive line is elite and the front seven continues to play hard, and that's bad news for the Vols on offense given the liability the offensive line is. I also worry about Tennessee's defensive speed trying to defend all the unconventional things and perimeter runs the Tigers do on offense. Ultimately those factors tilt this thing to Auburn for me, though I think an improving defense and Jeremy Pruitt's defensive game plan will get the Vols into the fourth quarter with a chance to win.

I correctly predicted a 26-point loss to Georgia two weeks ago. It appears to be the number du jour for whatever reason for this season. In that vein, I'll take Auburn to win and Tennessee to cover in a low-scoring rockfight. AUBURN 19, TENNESSEE 7
